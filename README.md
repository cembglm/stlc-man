# STLC Manager: An AI-Powered Software Testing Life Cycle Management System

## Abstract

This repository presents a comprehensive full-stack application designed to automate and manage the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) through artificial intelligence integration. The system implements eleven distinct STLC modules, leveraging multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide intelligent automation across all phases of software testing. Built upon a modern technology stack comprising FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, the platform demonstrates significant performance improvements in testing workflow efficiency and quality assurance processes.

## 1. Introduction

Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) represents a critical phase in software development, encompassing systematic processes from requirement analysis to test closure. Traditional STLC implementation faces challenges including manual effort redundancy, inconsistent documentation standards, and suboptimal resource allocation. This project addresses these challenges through AI-driven automation, implementing industry standards including ISTQB (International Software Testing Qualifications Board) methodologies and IEEE testing frameworks.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 STLC Module Specifications

The system implements eleven comprehensive STLC modules, each designed according to established software engineering principles:

| Module ID | Component | Functionality |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|

| 2 | Requirement Analysis | Requirement validation, gap analysis, compliance verification |
| 3 | Test Planning | Resource allocation, timeline management, Gantt chart generation |
| 4 | Environment Setup | Configuration management |
| 5 | Test Scenario Generation | Comprehensive test scenario generation |
| 6 | Test Case Generation | Detailed test case specification, step-by-step procedures |
| 7 | Test Case Optimization | Samrt selection for generated test cases |
| 8 | Test Code Generation | Automated test script generation |
| 9 | Test Execution | Automated test running using the MCP Server |
| 10 | Test Reporting | Comprehensive reporting, stakeholder communication |
| 11 | Test Closure | Process completion analysis |
